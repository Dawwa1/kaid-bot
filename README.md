## Kaid Bot

A multipurpose, all-in-one bot.

this bot is very outdated at the moment. very big update (1.0) is coming soon, overhaling the entire bot. below are just **SOME** of the things that are going to be changed

- Database ported to MongoDB
- All commands modified, most commands completely rewritten
- A bunch more commands (30+ commands)
- Command-based config editing

release data is set for Dec. 23rd or earlier. after that I will be doing monthly updates to keep the bot up-to-date, fixing bugs, and adding new features.

i recommend not opening or forking this repo until the big update, as every aspect of the bot will be modified. any issues will be ignored until after the release.
