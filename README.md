# Kaid Bot

A multipurpose, all-in-one bot that is currently undergoing a major overhaul. The update (1.0) will include the following changes:

- made all commands slash commands
- Database will be migrated to MongoDB
- All commands will be modified, with most being completely rewritten
- Over 30 new commands will be added
- Command-based config editing will be introduced

The release date is set for December 23rd or earlier. After that, I will be releasing monthly updates to keep the bot up-to-date, fix bugs, and add new features.

**Important:** I recommend not opening or forking this repository until the update is released, as every aspect of the bot will be modified. Any issues will be ignored until after the release.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
